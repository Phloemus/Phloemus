# Hi ! My name is Phloemus, nice to meet you  

The thing I love the most is to have the unfair power we programmers all whare : 
Being able to build something from thin air.

With our hands any idea born in our mind can be shaped into a great thing, connecting 
people together, having a impact on this world.

If you too, let go your imagination and thoughts to your creation desires, let's code 
together !

## Meet my projects 

I currently have a lot of project launched, 

## Contribute and join the community

A small community of students is developping on gingembre.org. Go on the 
plateform to get in touch with the community and share your courses, study tips,
and find teamates to study with in there, it's a pretty nice place to be !

## Engage the conversation at any time

I am always searching for new things to do, new horizion to explore and 
of course new people to meet. 

So if you are developping a project, get in touch. We could talk about your
project and collaborate together. And any feedback on my projects is welcomed !
